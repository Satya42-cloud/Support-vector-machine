## Mushroom Dataset Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Overview
This repository focuses on classifying mushroom types using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The project encompasses a series of tasks from data exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and optimization. We utilize the well-known Mushroom dataset to demonstrate these tasks.

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Loading: Loaded the Mushroom dataset for initial exploration.
- Feature Analysis: Utilized histograms, box plots, and density plots to examine feature distributions.
- Correlation Investigation: Analyzed feature correlations to identify relationships within the data.

### Task 2: Data Preprocessing
- Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numerical format suitable for model training.
- Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for model evaluation.

### Task 3: Data Visualization
- Feature Distributions: Employed scatter plots, pair plots, and other visualizations to understand feature relationships.
- Class Distribution: Visualized class distributions to assess the balance or imbalance in the dataset.

### Task 4: SVM Implementation
- Model Training: Implemented a basic SVM classifier using scikit-learn and trained the model on the training data.
- Performance Evaluation: Assessed model performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Task 5: Visualization of SVM Results
- Classification Results: Visualized the SVM classification results on the testing data to interpret model performance.

### Task 6: Parameter Tuning and Optimization
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimented with various SVM hyperparameters (e.g., kernel type, regularization parameter) to optimize model performance.

### Task 7: Comparison and Analysis
- Kernel Comparison: Compared SVM performance across different kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function) to determine the best-performing configuration.
